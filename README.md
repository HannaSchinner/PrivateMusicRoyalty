## üéØ Core Concepts

### FHE Smart Contract Technology

This project leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** provided by Zama's fhEVM to enable confidential on-chain computations. Unlike traditional blockchain contracts where all data is publicly visible, FHE allows mathematical operations to be performed on encrypted data without ever decrypting it.

**Key FHE Features:**
- **Encrypted State Variables**: Revenue shares and payment amounts are stored as encrypted integers (`euint32`, `euint64`)
- **Confidential Computation**: Calculate royalty distributions without exposing individual share percentages
- **Privacy Preservation**: Only rights holders can decrypt and view their own payment information
- **On-Chain Privacy**: Maintain blockchain transparency while protecting sensitive financial data

### Confidential Music Revenue Distribution

Traditional music royalty systems expose sensitive financial information to all parties. Our system introduces **confidential revenue distribution** where:

1. **Private Share Allocation**: Each rights holder's percentage share is encrypted on-chain
2. **Hidden Revenue Amounts**: Total pool amounts are visible, but individual payouts remain private
3. **Verifiable Fairness**: Mathematical correctness is guaranteed without revealing private data
4. **Selective Disclosure**: Rights holders can prove their share without exposing exact amounts

**How It Works:**
```
Music Track Registration ‚Üí Encrypted Shares (euint32)
     ‚Üì
Royalty Pool Creation ‚Üí Encrypted Total Amount (euint64)
     ‚Üì
Distribution Calculation ‚Üí FHE Multiplication & Division
     ‚Üì
Private Claims ‚Üí Decryption Oracle ‚Üí Individual Payments
```

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîê Privacy Protection
- **FHE Encryption**: Copyright shares and revenue amounts are encrypted using Zama fhEVM
- **Confidential Computing**: Revenue distribution calculations without exposing specific amounts
- **Selective Decryption**: Only rights holders can decrypt their own revenue shares

### üéº Music Rights Management
- **Rights Holder Registration**: Creators, producers, and distributors can register as rights holders
- **Track Registration**: On-chain music work registration with metadata storage
- **Flexible Share Allocation**: Configure encrypted copyright shares for each rights holder

### üí∞ Revenue Distribution
- **Royalty Pool Creation**: Create distribution pools for each music track
- **Automatic Allocation**: Automatically calculate rights holder payments based on encrypted shares
- **Secure Withdrawal**: Rights holders can securely claim their earnings

### üîí Security Mechanisms
- **Rights Holder Verification**: Identity verification required before operations
- **Encrypted Shares**: Copyright shares encrypted with FHE technology
- **Asynchronous Decryption**: Zama's async decryption oracle ensures security
